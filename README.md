# Introduction #

This script will attempt to auto install 1fx Mod and SoF2 1.00 on Linux. I made this script for people that are still new to Linux and would
just like to install 1fx mod and Sof2 on their VPS / Linux PC, without messing around with it too much. 

Please note that this script is not guaranteed to work another thing to remember is that this script is 
only supported under Debian/Ubuntu. 

If you have any questions or concerns you can contact me on 1fx. Forums. 

### How to start this script? ###

First of all make sure you've root access.

To run this script execute the following commands:
 *1. chmod +x 1fxmod.sh (you only need to do this the first time.)
 *2. sudo ./1fxmod.sh (or if you're already root) ./1fxmod.sh
